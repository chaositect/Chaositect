Hello, from @gisaacs

I'm a Business Intelligence Analyst and Data Scientist with an ever-growing passion for the field of machine learning and advanced computer applications.

I enjoy the challenges presented by business analytics, from data capture and preprocessing to predictive outputs and cross-validation.
It is a truly fascinating field and I've endeavored to learn all that I can about it.

Within this public git-space you will find a collection of algorithms that I employ on a regular basis.
These examples use small data sets but the algorithms themselves can be scaled to fit larger volumes of data.

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me at grant@chaositect.com
